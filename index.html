            <p><strong>Sign Language interpretation</strong> </p>
            <p>Interpreters must process language with optimal speed and accuracy, and they must think about spoken language and sign language simultaneously. Interpreting is also about being able to support the educational goals and outcomes. My research
                interest is to figure out how best educational sign language interpreters should be trained, challenges they face, and how best to measure their effectiveness. </p>
            <p><strong> strategies for students who are deaf and hard of hearing</strong></p>
            <p> Research over time has revealed a number of instructional strategies to be applied to students who are deaf and hard of hearing. These include: bilingual/bicultural method, auditory/oral method and total communication. I intend to explore
                what are the best strategies to teach deaf students to read and comprehend English grammar.</p>
